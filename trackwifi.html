				<h1>Track Wi-Fi Devices & Connect to Them Using Probequest </h1>
				<p>Wi-Fi devices are continually emitting "probe frames," calling out for nearby Wi-Fi networks to connect to. Beyond being a privacy risk, probe frames can also be used to track or take over the data connection of nearby devices. We'll explain how to see nearby devices emitting probe frames using Probequest and what can be done with this information.
					In order to function, Wi-Fi devices are always doing one of two things to try to discover available networks; They either send out beacon frames or probe frames.
				</p>
				<h2>How Beacon Frames Work</h2>
				<p>
					Wi-Fi access points (APs) emit packets called beacon frames which contain information about the access point they are advertising. This information allows nearby devices to be aware that the access point exists and to decide whether or not the network has been connected to before. If the network is recognized by a device, the device will attempt to connect to the network.

                     By opening a beacon frame in Wireshark, we can see that they contain information about the device that transmitted the packet, the Wi-Fi network the beacon frame is advertising, and information about what channel the AP is operating on and what speeds that the network supports. This is how your phone and laptop can offer you a list of networks nearby seemingly out of thin air, as your device will detect these packets and provide the user the ability to connect if they want to.
										
					</p>
				<iframe width="980" height="530" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z8RHMUSYTiA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
				<h2>How Probe Frames Work</h2>
				<p>
					The second way a Wi-Fi connection happens is when your device attempts to find a nearby network to connect to by sending out a kind of packet called a probe frame.

                    frames function in almost the opposite way of beacon frames. The client device will send out packets searching for Wi-Fi networks to which it has recently been connected. This allows you to quickly and seamlessly reconnect to networks like your home or work network if you are disconnected or momentarily wander out of the coverage of the network.

                    In Wireshark, we can look at a probe frame to discover information about the device sending the packet, as well as the name and channel number of the access point it is calling for. You can see the following probe frames transmitted on a subway train:
				</p>
				
				<p>
					

                   Devices like laptops and smartphones will send out probe frames on all channels even when the Wi-Fi is turned off. This is because Wi-Fi-assisted geolocation is turned on by default and is not affected by the Wi-Fi connection option being turned off. So, in general, turning off your smartphone's Wi-Fi alone will not prevent the device from sending probe frames.
                    <br>
                    <br>
					Another key function of Nmap is to allow for port scanning of either individual devices or ranges of IP addresses including many devices. This allows an attacker to learn the minute details of a device they have discovered on a network, including information about ports open and services running. Ports are gateways that another device can connect through, so finding a bunch of services running on open ports can be a huge benefit to a hacker, especially if one of them has a version that is out of date and vulnerable.
				</p>
				<h2>Using Nmap for Remote Networks</h2>
				<p>
				   In addition to scanning local networks, Nmap can also show information about remote networks as well. In fact, you can run Nmap against a website you want to examine, and it will parse it and retrieve the IP address associated with that web domain.
			    </p>
               

               <p>
               	After grabbing the IP address and taking note of the port numbers that are open, further Nmap scans can reveal the operating system (-O) being used to host a remote website.
               </p>
               <img src="images/article1/image3.png" alt="">
               <p>
                  Finally, we can even learn about the versions of software running on the ports we find open. If we see one that is vulnerable to a known attack, this could make our job on the network much easier. Using the IP address we discovered earlier, we can run another scan with -sV that reveals that httpd 2.0 is being used on the target machine.
               </p>

               
               <p>
               	   These details combined — the IP address of a remote website or server, the operating system running on the device, and the version of any application running on open ports we discover — is everything a hacker needs to get started attacking devices on a network.
               </p>
               <h2>What Probe Frames Can Show</h2>
               <p>
               	    This practice has attracted attention from security researchers like Mathy Vanhoef, who showed that probe frames can be used to track users with a high degree of precision and that even attempts to prevent this (like randomizing the MAC address used in probe frames sent by client devices) is not very useful in preventing tracking. Mathy's work has uncovered many ways of reading into the information contained in probe frames, including multiple ways of revealing a nearby device's real MAC address.

                    MAC address randomization is often done in ways that are not consistent or genuinely random enough to be effective, including sending the device's real MAC address in response to any beacon frame the device recognized, including ESSID's like "Google Starbucks." This means most people walking by a coffee shop with free Wi-Fi they've used before are momentarily de-cloaked while they are within range.
				</p>
				<h2><strong>Step 1 : </strong>Configure Nmap to Scan a Single Target</h2>
				<p>
					To run a basic scan, we can identify an IP address of interest to run the scan against. One of the most basic but informative scans is to run Nmap, specify a target IP address, and then type -A to enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

				</p>
				<img src="images/article1/image5.png" alt="">
				<p>
					Even against a single target, a basic scan can yield a lot of information. Here, we simply ran the scan on the IP address for WonderHowTo.com. This can be run against a device on your local network, like a router, or a remote server, like the one hosting WonderHowTo.com.
				</p>
				<h2><strong>Step 2 : </strong> Calculate the Subnet & Scan a Range to Discover Devices</h2>
  		        <p>
                   In order to identify other devices on a local network, it's useful to calculate the subnet range. This is the range of possible IP addresses given out to devices on a network, and knowing it allows you to scan through all the possible IP addresses a device on the network could have.
                <br><br>
                   A handy tool to do this for you is IPcalc. This tool will take your IP address (which is easy to find by typing ifconfig or ip a in a terminal window) and calculate the subnet range based on it. Doing so will give you a number like "192.168.0.0/24," which specifies a range of IP addresses. In the example below, the subnet is calculated as 127.0.0.0/24.
		
				</p>
				<img src="images/article1/image6.png" alt="">
				<p>
					In order to run a scan including information about the services running on devices we find, we can open a terminal window and type the following command, adding in your network range where I use "172.16.42.0/24" as an example. The scan is a little slow, so you can also use an -F flag instead of the -A to do a faster scan of the most common ports.
				</p>
				
                <p>
                	We're basically running Nmap with no arguments except the -A flag. We should expect to see an output like above, showing discovered devices and the services running on them.
					<br><br>
                    Another handy tool for network discovery is arp-scan, which can sometimes show devices that Nmap misses. We can use Nmap to conduct an ARP scan with the -PR request, which is quite fast and aggressive at bringing back online hosts.
                </p>
                <img src="images/article1/image8.png" alt="">
                <h2><strong>Step 3 : </strong>Create a Target List of Active Hosts</h2>
                <p>
                	Now we can calculate all the possible IP addresses on the local network and discover them either with a -F (fast) scan, by running Nmap with no arguments but the -A flag for a slower scan with more info, or with a -PR scan capable of quickly sweeping a local network for active hosts.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, if you want to create a TXT file of hosts you discovered, you can use the command seen below to build a list to avoid needing to scan the entire network each time we run a subsequent scan. For instance, to scan for devices with a port 80 open and save them to a list, we can use some Linux tools and the -oG "greppable output" flag to help us cut through the output Nmap provides.
                </p>
                <p>
                	By running nmap -p 80 -oG - 192.168.0.0/24 — with the network range substituted for yours — you can add | awk '/80\/open/ {print $2}' >> port80.txt to output the IP addresses belonging to discovered devices to a TXT file called "port80.txt."
                </p>
                <img src="images/article1/image9.png" alt="">
                <p>
                	Here, the awk command is looking for lines containing the port number and the result "open," with the second string in each line (in this case, the IP address) saved by the cat command to a new file called port80.txt
                </p>
                <h2><strong>Step 4 : </strong>Identify the Operating System on Discovered Devices</h2>
                <p>
                	One of the most helpful things to know about a device we discover on a network is the operating system it's running. Here, we can take the TXT target list we populated in the previous step and run an operating system scan, which requires root privileges. We can use the -O flag to run an operating system scan, and the -iL flag to tell Nmap we want to read from a TXT file of target hosts.
                </p>
                <img src="images/article1/image10.png" alt="">
                <p>
                	This tactic allows us to get as much information as possible about the operating system from whatever list of targets we want to run it against, whether internal network targets or a list of website IP addresses.
                </p>
                <p>
                	The next step is discovering the versions of the applications running on open ports. This may show us a port that is running software that is out of date and has a known vulnerability. To run this scan, you can use the -sV flag against a target.
                </p>
                <img src="images/article1/image11.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    Here, we've found some very specific information about our host, allowing us to potentially identify an attack against the software listening behind the port.
                </p>
                <h2><strong>Step 5 : </strong>Advanced Scans & Workarounds</h2>
                <p>
                	There may be some circumstances where you're having a difficult time scanning a network because the ping sent by Nmap are dropped by a firewall on the router. This can make it look like no devices are up, when you know they are. To avoid this, you can include the -Pn flag, which will drop the ping and sometimes allow you to connect directly to devices and get a response.
                     <br><br>
                    If you're scanning on a network you don't want to be detected on, you can perform a decoy scan with the -D flag to make it more difficult to detect who is conducting the scan on the network. An example would look like the command below, and requires root privileges.
                </p>
                <img src="images/article1/image12.png" alt="">
                <p>
                	If you need more information about what's happening, you can strike a key while the scan is progressing to get some information about how it's proceeding or add a -v to increase the verbosity (how much information the script gives). Generally, you can keep adding more v's to the -v according to how frustrated or angry you get to learn more information about what's happening.
                </p>
                <img src="images/article1/image13.png" alt="">
                <p>
                	Here, we can see the reason reported for the port 80 being up, allowing us to delve deeper into what parts of a scan a device may be replying to or ignoring. Be warned, you will see everything the scan is doing, and this can produce a lot of output on a complicated scan.
                </p>
				<h2> Nmap Lights Up the Dark</h2>
				<p>
				   Finding your way around a network for the first time can be a harrowing experience for a beginner, whether you're learning about network exploitation for the first time or simply trying to find your router.
				</p>
				<p>
				   Keep in mind, while networks scans are fine (and a great idea) to run on your own network to see what's connected, this kind of scan may not be welcome on your work network or another network you don't own. If your employer looks for suspicious behavior on their networks, extensively scanning can be easily interpreted as the threatening behavior if you have no good reason to be performing the scan.
				</p>
				<p>
				   One of the most powerful things about Nmap is that it's scriptable with options like -oG and can be used to feed into other tools, so if you've ever imagined building a tool that needs to be aware of other devices on the same network, Nmap might be just what  you're looking for.
