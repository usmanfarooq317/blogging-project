Nmap gives you the ability to explore any devices connected to a network, finding information like the operating system a device is running and which applications are listening on open ports. This information lets a hacker design an attack that perfectly suits the target environment." />

This has led Facebook to break records numbers with over 1.94 billion monthly active users, as of March 2017 â€” and around 1.28 billion daily active users. 
We share our lives on Facebook. We share our birthdays and our anniversaries. We share our vacation plans and locations. We share the births of our sons and the deaths of our fathers. We share our most cherished moments and our most painful thoughts. We divulge every aspect of our lives. Clinical psychologists have written entire books detailing the surprisingly extensive impact Facebook has on our emotions and relationships." />

To ease into the process, let&apos;s discuss automating and optimizing brute-force attacks for potentially vulnerable services such as SMTP, SSH, IMAP, and FTP discovered by Nmap, a popular network scanning utility. BruteSpray, developed by Jacob Robles and Shane Young, is a Python script capable of processing an Nmap scan output and automating brute-force attacks against discovered services using Medusa, a popular brute-forcing tool. BruteSpray is the much-needed nexus that unifies Nmap scans and brute-force attacks." />

Due to the way hashes work, not all are created equal. Some are more vulnerable than others, and a little Python could be used to brute-force any weak hashes to get the passwords they were created from." />

If the user passwords on the system can be obtained and cracked, an attacker can use them to pivot to other machines if the login is the same across systems. There are two tried-and-true password cracking tools that can accomplish this: John the Ripper and Hashcat." data-texteffect="Bottom bar" data-duration="4000" />
