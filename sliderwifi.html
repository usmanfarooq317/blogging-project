Purpose-built jammer hardware is outright illegal in many countries, but Wi-Fi is vulnerable to several different jamming attacks that can be done with Kali Linux and a wireless network adapter. 
Traditional signal jamming has been a cat and mouse game of detecting and disabling signals an opponent is using to communicate. Cutting off a target&apos;s ability to communicate leaves them isolated and vulnerable, making jamming these signals a top priority in modern day electronic warfare. Countries today have developed capabilities to jam and spoof cell phones, GPS, Wi-Fi, and even satellite links." />

Beyond being a privacy risk, probe frames can also be used to track or take over the data connection of nearby devices. We&apos;ll explain how to see nearby devices emitting probe frames using Probequest and what can be done with this information. In order to function, Wi-Fi devices are always doing one of two things to try to discover available networks; They either send out beacon frames or probe frames." />

To ease into the process, let&apos;s discuss automating and optimizing brute-force attacks for potentially vulnerable services such as SMTP, SSH, IMAP, and FTP discovered by Nmap, a popular network scanning utility. BruteSpray, developed by Jacob Robles and Shane Young, is a Python script capable of processing an Nmap scan output and automating brute-force attacks against discovered services using Medusa, a popular brute-forcing tool. BruteSpray is the much-needed nexus that unifies Nmap scans and brute-force attacks." />
